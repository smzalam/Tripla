    <blockquote>
        <p>I am going to be working solo on this project as I find it easier to work in a group of one rather than in pairs. Nevertheless, the owner and creator of this project is going to be me. I look forward to showing you all what I end up creating! </p>

    <h2>Intro and Goal</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>My physics teacher in Grade 12 of high school had us do a quiz in the form a game. Namely, the class was divided into two teams, and we took turns back and forth answering physics questions in the form of a battleship game. Whoever got a question right got the right to make a move on the board. It was a very fun experience, and so this app is based on that type of game.</p>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>With covid times and quarantine making leanring all the more personal, having a system like Tripla at hand makes it easier to incorporate inclusively and interactivity within the classroom. It makes sure everyone is paying attention within their teams and that they can have fun too in a friendly, competitive atmosphere.</p>

    <h2>Audience</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>It is for any person interested in making use of it. The purpose of use of Tripla is meant to be very similar to Kahoot, i.e. flexible and not limited to education although education is what the basis of Tripla is.</p>

    <h2>Wireframes/Prototype</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>My prototype for Tripla is made on Figma: <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/ruQNqok0CEmkNF7h8KUR5o/tripla?node-id=0%3A1" target="_blank">Workflow</a></p>
        <p>Initially, I have decided to cut out the parts that are contained by a grey rectangle. If I have time I will incorporate those pages, but before those, I will be working on the other pages and the backend logic.</p>
